# Clean Link

This project was bootstrapped with [create-expo-app](https://docs.expo.dev/).

Share clean links!

## Background

Almost every link we share includes some type of additional identification, source, or tag that allows for some level of tracking between users or sources. Instead of manually removing these, links can be shared to Clean Link where they are automatically sanitized and can then be shared to the intended recipient.
